# PodTunnel

PodTunnel is a [Kubernetes] operator which enables the creation and management
of [secure network tunnels] for [Pods] and [Nodes].

The main design philosophies of PodTunnel are to be **composable** and to
**support a variety of different configurations**. PodTunnel can be used
directly, or in higher level solutions to automate more complicated topologies.
